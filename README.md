It works similar to bit.ly.
This app was deployed to herokuapp.
It creates short uniq url for any kind of links. 
When generating link program checks if it has already been there in database.

{
"nickname": "ACF7T",

paste: https://link-reducer.onrender.com to address bar of your web browser and press "Enter"
It will redirect to the original site - google.com

If you do not need this link, just take generated part of link in "nickname": "ACF7T"
and paste it to description field and press "Execute".
